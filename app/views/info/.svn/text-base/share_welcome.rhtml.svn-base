<h2 class="welcome_page">CellStories is a new kind of reading experience: a mobile one. Really, we think that the best way to read something is holding it gently in your hand, not sitting at a desk or precariously balancing a laptop on your lap. </h2>
	<div id="storybox">
	<p><strong><%= @story.title rescue nil %></strong> by <%= @story.author.name rescue nil %> is ready for you to read on your mobile device.
	</div>
	<p>Stories like "<%= @story.title rescue nil %>" deserve a space where you can really dive deep into the storytelling: your couch, the train, under a tree. We promise, it's awesome.</p>

Or, if you have a phone that can read QR codes, just zap the link to the left and your phone will take you right to "<%= @story.title rescue nil %>."</p>
	<p>Thank you so much!</p>
